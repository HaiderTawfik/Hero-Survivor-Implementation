Game Objective: There will be 3 waves that the two players will have to work together to survive. Each wave new enemies will spawn, and in increasing amounts and variety.

Game mechanics: This is a two-player game in which both players will have to work together to survive 3 waves of enemies, a wave is cleared when a set amount of enemies have been spawned and defeated. Each player has a set amount of enemies to defeat on their side of the map before the wave progresses. Each wave becomes increasingly more difficult, whether it be by numbers of enemies, or by different stronger enemy variants spawning. The players must sucessfully defeat all enemies on their side of the map on wave 3 inorder to win. Player 1 will control their movement with wasd and use q to attack with a sword, Player 2 will control their movement with the arrow keys and use "/" to attack with a sword. Enemies will spawn in predefined locations each round and will begin to chase the player on their side of the map when they spawn, enemies will be defeated when the player hits them enough times such that their health drops to zero.
