Title: Hero Survivor

Target Platform: Desktop

Game Genre: Action

Game Objective: There will be 3 waves that the two players will have to work together to survive. Each wave new enemies will spawn, and in increasing amounts and variety, with the final wave (wave 3) including a boss-type enemy that the players will have to defeat in order to win alongside any other enemies that spawn on wave 3.

Rules of the Game: Players need to avoid getting hit by enemies, if hit by an enemy a player will lose health, and when both player's hp falls below 0 the game will end. Power-ups can be found in random chests that will spawn on the map, if the players find a chest they can walk into it to obtain a random power-up such as speed buffs, damage buffs, and defense buffs. Speed buffs increase the player's movement speed, damage buffs increase the amount of damage the players do to enemies, and defense buffs decrease the damage taken when hit.  Enemies have a chance to inflict debuffs on players if they hit them, these include things such as slowing down the player, or causing them to lose health over time, these debuffs will go away after a set amount of time passes.

Game mechanics: This is a two-player game in which both players will have to work together to survive 3 waves of enemies, a wave is cleared when a set amount of enemies have been spawned and defeated. Each wave becomes increasingly more difficult, whether it be by numbers of enemies, or by different stronger enemy variants spawning. In the third and final wave a boss will spawn along with other enemies, players must successfully defeat the boss and enemies in order to win. Player 1 will control their movement with wasd and use q to attack with a sword, Player 2 will control their movement with the arrow keys and use "/" to attack with a sword (note I may change swords to spells if time permits and all other functionality is implemented). Enemies will spawn in predefined locations each round and will begin to chase the nearest player when they spawn, enemies will be defeated when the player hits them enough times such that their health drops to zero.
